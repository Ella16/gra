General Status of 2022
Drug Approval and
Notification
- 1 -1. General Status of 2022 Drug Approval and
Notification
The 2022 Drug Approval Report is intended to share the status of
all the approved and notified drugs organized and analyzed in
multiple ways for establishing and executing pertinent policies,
streamlining and systematizing approval and notification tasks and
boosting the product development, which is in line with the 2021
Drug Approval Report.
1.1. General Status
The 1,636 items were approved and notified in 2022, as shown in Table 1,
including chemical drugs, biologics and herbal medicinal products. The total
number of items decreased by around 29.1% (634 items) compared to the previous
year, and in particular, the number of approved and notified manufacturing
items and items of Regional FDS decreased by 29.0% (609 items) and 47.7% (845
items), respectively. The decrease seems to be attributed to the decline in generic
drug approvals due to the limitation on the number of approved items for the
joint use of clinical trial (bioequivalence test) data, introduced in July 2021.
Approved items accounted for 1,081 items (66.1%) and notified ones took up
555 items (33.9%) of the total (1,636 items).
According to the institution-specific analysis of the total, 710 items (43.4%)
were approved by the MFDS and 926 items (56.6%) were approved and
notified by the Regional FDS, which indicates that the number of items
approved and notified by the Regional FDS decreased than that of the
previous year, while that of approved items by the MFDS increased.
According to manufactured/imported item category, domestically manufactured
and marketed items were 1,490 items (91.1%), whereas imported ones
accounted for 146 items (8.9%), indicating that the number of domestically
- 3 -manufactured items remains high compared with that of the imported items
for all its slightly increasing year-on-year.
Drug products accounted for 1,451 items (87.7%), drug substances 76 items (4.6%),
and medicinal herbs 109 items (6.7%), which indicates that the proportion of drug
products was the same as the previous year without any significant change, and
the proportions of drug substances and medicinal herbs showed some changes.
The proportions of drug products and drug substances were 95.0% (1,451
items) and 5.0% (76 items), respectively, when excluding medicinal herbs, with
drug products accounting for the majority, and 75.6% were ETC drugs (1,097
items), and 24.4% were OTC drugs (354 items) among the drug products.

- 7 -The institution-specific analysis (Table 3-1) of the drug approval and
notification in 2022 shows that the regional FDS approved 371 items (34.3%) while
the MFDS approved 710 items (65.7%) of the total 1,081 approved items,
showing that the number of items approved by the MFDS is double that of the
Regional FDS. It is attributed to the sharp decrease in the number of generic
drug items approved by the regional FDS whereas that of the approved items
by the MFDS remained at a similar level to the previous one.

Based on anlysis of the annual trends of each drug type approved and
notified, the number of approved and notified items by drug type was similar
in 2017 and 2018, but in 2019, the number (6,187 items) increased by around
2.5 times that in 2018. However, the number of approved and notified ETC,
OTC and medicinal herbs decreased again after 2020, which is presumed to be
due to the trend of decrease in generic drugs following the limitation on the
number (3 times) of joint use of clinical (bioequivalence test) study data.
Specifically, 1,097 ETC drugs, 354 OTC drugs, 76 drug substances and 109
medicinal herbs were approved in 2022, showing decrease in number by 28.9%

items) approved in 2022 decreased from that of approved items (37 items) in
2021. 76.7% of new drugs were imported items, similar to the previous year
(78.4%), showing that the majority of new drugs were still imported (refer to
Table 13-1, Figure 3).
According to the new drug approval status by year, 1-2 items of
domestically developed new drugs were consistently approved per year (5
items in 2015 and 2021), and 2 items were developed domestically in 2022.
The number of new imported chemical drugs decreased by 4 items compared
to the previous year, and the number of manufactured biologics decreased by
1 item, contributing to the similar one to the previous year. The decrease in
new drug approvals in 2022 is due to the decrease in new imported chemical
drugs (refer to Table 13-2).

- 48 -In 2022, the drug approval system underwent the following changes.
As the supply of active ingredients of medicines for cold had been disrupted
due to the resurgence of COVID-19, a plan for applying multiple standards for
some ingredients was quickly prepared to booster production and stable supply
of medicines for cold. In November 2022, the subjects for the “official
communication channel for medical products” pilot operation were expanded
to some kinds of drugs requiring data submission, so that drugs with new
composition of active ingredients and drugs with new therapeutic class can also
be handled through the pathway. It is operated by applying civil service
counseling results conducted in the process of medical products approval and
review to the approved and reviewed contents.
In addition, for advancement and international harmonization of regulatory, a
method of managing manufacturing methods based on the Common Technical
Document (CTD) was introduced. In order to prevent confusion from the
introduction of the system and increase the efficiency of work procedures, the
“Guidelines for Management of Matters Approved Following the Adoption of
Manufacturing Method based on CTD (Guidelines for Applicants)” were
established to prepare detailed work procedures. The guidelines were
disseminated to related associations, etc. The guidelines for applicants are
available on the MFDS official website (www.mfds.go.kr) at ▶ Electronic Civil
Petitions ▶ Guidelines for Industries ▶ Guidelines for Public Officials/
Guidelines for Applicants.

Transfer Inhibitor) involved in the insertion of HIV virus DNA into human DNA.
“Epclusa Tablet” (Gilead Sciences Korea Ltd., approved on 2022.2.17.) is
used in itself or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of genotypes
1-6 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV). The active ingredients “sofosbuvir”
and “velpatasvir” inhibit 5B (NS5B) polymerase, a protein involved in
HCV RNA proliferation in the cytoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum, and
non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) of HCV virus, respectively, to block viral
replication and hyperplasia.
“Vosevi Tablet” (Gilead Sciences Korea Ltd., approved on 2022.3.23.) is a
treatment for patients with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 who were treated with
HCV therapy including NS5A inhibitors and patients with genotype 1a or 3
who were treated with HCV therapy including sofosbuvir without NS5A
inhibitors, among adult patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection
- 52 -without hepatocirrhosis or with compensated hepatocirrhosis. The active
ingredients “sofosbuvir,” “velpatasvir,” and “voxilaprevir” inhibits 5B (NS5B)
polymerase, a protein involved in HCV RNA proliferation in the cytoplasmic
endoplasmic reticulum, non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) of HCV virus, and NS3/4A
proteolytic enzymes, respectively, to block viral replication and hyperplasia.
“Jyseleca 100 mg, 200 mg Film-coated Tablets (filgotinib maleate)” (Eisai
Korea Inc., approved on 2022.4.1.) is used in the treatment of moderate to
severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adults who response inadequately or do
not have tolerability to one or more antirheumatic drugs. The active
ingredient “filgotinib maleate” improves rheumatoid arthritis by inhibiting
JAK (Janus Kinase), which is involved in signal transduction in the inflammatory
response, and blocking intracellular signal transduction mediated by cytokines.
“Inrebic Capsule (fedratinib hydrochloride hydrate)” (BMS Pharmaceutical
Korea Ltd., approved on 2022.4.27.) is used to treat splenomegaly or symptoms
related to ▲ primary myelofibrosis ▲ myelofibrosis after polycythemia vera
▲ post-polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis in adult patients who were previously
treated with ruxolitinib. The active ingredient “fedratinib hydrochloride
hydrate” inhibits the hyperplasia of malignant tumor cells by inhibiting
JAK2 (Janus Kinase) and reducing the phosphorylation of cell signaling factors
and transcriptional activator proteins.
“Kerendia Tablet 10, 20 mg (finerenone)” (Bayer Korea Ltd., approved on
2022.5.10.) is effective in reducing the risk of the hospitalization due to ▲
continuous decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate in adult patients
with chronic kidney disease with type 2 diabetes, ▲ reaching end-stage renal
- 53 -disease, ▲ death due to cardiovascular disease, and ▲ non-fatal myocardial
infarction and heart failure. The active ingredient “finerenone” is a
non-steroidal selective Mineral corticoid Receptor Antagonist, which
attenuates inflammation and fibrosis mediated by an increase in
mineralocorticoid receptors.
“REYVOW Tablet 50, 100 mg (lasmiditan hemisuccinate)” (Ildong
Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., approved on 2022.05.11.) is an acute treatment of
migraine with or without aura. The active ingredient “lasmiditan
hemisuccinate” is a selective serotonin 1F (5HT1F) receptor agonist, which
exerts therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine by reducing
neuropeptide release and inhibiting pain transmission pathways including at
the trigeminal nerve.
“Beova Tablet 50 mg (vibegron)” (JEIL PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD.,
approved on 2022.10.31.) is used to treat symptoms of urinary urgency,
urinary frequency, and urge incontinence of overactive bladder. The active
ingredient “vibegron” improves overactive bladder by selectively acting on β3
adrenergic receptors to relax muscles (smooth muscles) surrounding the bladder.

- 64 -2.3. Approval Status of Incrementally Modified Drugs
“Incrementally modified drugs” refers to the drugs that the Minister of
Food and Drug Safety designates as incrementally modified or medicinally
advanced in its safety, efficacy, and usability (medication compliance,
convenience, etc.) compared to approved/notified drugs requiring data
submission under Article 2(8) of the ‘Regulations for Pharmaceutical
Approval, Notification and Reviews’
The development types of recently approved incrementally modified
drugs are as follows: From 2016 to 2017, combination drugs with new
composition of active substances (drugs containing 2 or more active
ingredients in one product) were noticeably developed. In 2018, 6
sustained-release tablet items with improved mode of administration and
dosage by reducing the number of intakes were designated as
incrementally modified drugs. In 2019, 11 items with improved efficacy and
2 items with improved usability were approved, totaling to approval of 13
designated incrementally modified drugs. In 2020, 5 items with improved
usability, including 4 sustained-release tablet items with improved intake
convenience and compliance by a change in dosage form and mode of
administration and dosage and 1 item with improved efficacy were
approved as incrementally modified drugs. In 2021, 3 new combination
drugs with new compositions of active ingredients and 4 items with
improved usability through change in the route of administration with new
dosage forms were designated as incrementally modified drugs. In 2022, 9
items, 7 items including combination drugs with improved compliance
through new compositions of active ingredients and 2 items improved
efficacy through change in the route of administration, were designated as
incrementally modified drugs (refer to Table 30).

The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety has been publishing the ｢Casebook
of approved incrementally modified drugs｣ (Guidance for applicants) since
November 2011. The casebook contains the current status and cases of
incrementally modified drugs for the domestic pharmaceutical industries to
utilize in drug research and development. The status of incrementally
modified drugs approved in 2022 will be reflected in the ｢Casebook of
approved incrementally modified drugs｣ (Guidance for applicants) for 2023,
including the approval status, product type-specific status, detailed
designation criteria by case, non-designated cases, etc.
Analyzing the incrementally modified drugs by their designation criteria,
drug with improved efficacy with a proven increase in therapeutic effects
(68 items, 50.7%) and those with improved usability through improvement
of formulation (55 items, 41.0%) accounted for 91.7% of the total
incrementally modified drugs, and those with designation of advancement
of pharmaceutical technology and those with improved safety accounted
for 5.2% (7 items) and 3.0% (4 items) respectively (Figure 7).

- 133 -3.1. Approval Status of Biopharmaceuticals
22 biopharmaceuticals were approved in 2022 (12 manufactured items, 10
imported items, 14 vaccines, 3 botulinum toxins, and 5 blood products).
By comparison, 15 items (10 manufactured items, 5 imported items, 8
vaccines, 7 botulinum toxins) were approved in 2021 and 20 items (18
manufactured items, 2 imported items, 9 vaccines, 7 botulinum toxins, 4
blood products) were approved in 2020. It is indicative of the decline in the
number of biopharmaceuticals approvals observed since 2020. But in 2022,
that of approvals slightly increased.
Vaccines approved in 2022 include 8 coronavirus infection-19
(hereinafter referred to as COVID-19) vaccines, 1 typhoid vaccine, 1
meningococcal vaccine, 1 influenza vaccine, and 2 combination vaccines
(refer to Table 42).
As for COVID-19 vaccines, 2 recombinant vaccines and 6 mRNA vaccines
were approved. A recombinant vaccine is produced from directly inserting
an antigen protein produced by recombinant technology, which stimulates
the production of antibodies that can fight the virus in the body. A mRNA
vaccine is produced from injecting the surface antigen gene of the
COVID-19 virus in the form of mRNA, which synthesizes antigen proteins
in the body, and induces the production of neutralizing antibodies, thereby
neutralizing and eliminating the virus when it invades the human body.
As for the recombinant vaccine, a manufactured and marketed item
“NUVAXOVID Pre-filled Syringe (SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Vaccine
(recombinant)),” which was developed by Novavax and produced by SK
- 134 -bioscience Co., Ltd., and a manufactured and marketed item “SkyCovione
Multi Injection (SARS-CoV-2 surface antigen vaccine (recombinant)),”
which was developed and produced by SK bioscience Co., Ltd, were
approved as a domestically manufactured new drug and a domestically
developed new drug, respectively.
Among the mRNA vaccines, 3 items were imported items of Pfizer
Korea Ltd., which were “Comirnaty Inj. 0.1 mg/mL (tozinameran)
(SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine),” “Comirnaty Inj. 0.1 mg/mL (5-11 Years)
(tozinameran) (SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine)” targeting children aged 5-11
years old, and “Comirnaty Inj. 0.1 mg/mL (6 Months - 4 Years)
(tozinameran) (SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine)” targeting children aged 6
months to 4 years old, and all of which were drugs requiring data submission.
Among the mRNA vaccines, the remaining 3 items approved are as
follows: an imported item, “Comirnaty 2 Injection 0.1mg/mL (tozinameran,
riltozinameran)” of Pfizer Korea Ltd., as a bivalent vaccine for
COVID-19 that expresses each antigen of the early COVID-19 virus and
the mutant virus (Omicron variant BA.1), “MODERNA SPIKEVAX BIVALENT
(Elasomeran, Imelasomeran) (SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine), a imported
item, and “SPIKEVAX BIVALENT (Elasomeran, Imelasomeran) (SARS-CoV-2
mRNA vaccine)”, a manufactured and marketed item, of Moderna Korea,
all of which were drugs requiring data submission.
The GSK Korea’s “Bexsero” as a meningococcal vaccine and a new
drug, was approved for the prevention of invasive meningococcal disease
caused by Neisseria meningitidis group B in children aged 2 months or older.
The MEDITIP’s “Fluad® Quad Prefilled Syringe” as both an influenza
vaccine and an imported item was approved, which is a preventive vaccine
- 135 -for influenza diseases caused by influenza A viruses and influenza B
viruses contained in this vaccine in the elderly aged 65 years or older.
As a combination vaccine, Sanofi Pasteur’s “Adacel Pre-filled Syringe
(adsorbed diphtheria, tetanus toxoid and purified pertussis combined
vaccine for adults)” as an imported item was approved, which is used for
the prevention of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. In addition, Boryeong
Biopharma’s “Boryeong TD Vaccine Pre-filled Syringe (adsorbed diphtheria
and tetanus combination vaccine for adults),”as a manufactured and
marketed item was approved for the prevention of diphtheria and tetanus.
As a typhoid vaccine, SK Bioscience Co., Ltd.’s “SKYTyphoid multi inj.
(Thyphoid purified Vi Polysaccharide Conjugated to Diphtheria toxoid
vaccine)” was approved.
In the case of botulinum toxin products, 4 items were newly approved in
2016, 2 items in 2017, 1 item in 2018, and 2 items (1 item for domestic use
and 1 item for export) in 2019, and 7 items for export in 2020, 7 items (6
items for domestic use, 1 item for export) in 2021, and 3 items (1 item for
domestic use, 2 items for export) in 2022 (refer to Table 42).
Among the botulinum toxin products approved in 2022, “ATOXIN Inj.”
from Daewoong Bio Inc. was approved for the temporary improvement of
moderate to severe glabellar lines associated with corrugator and/or
procerus muscle activities in adults aged between 20 and 65 years and the
treatment of upper extremity spasticity associated with stroke in adults
aged 18 years and older.
“TYEMVERS for injection(Clostridium botulinum Toxin Type A)(for
export)” from CKD BiO was approved for temporarily improving moderate
- 136 -to severe glabellar lines associated with corrugator and/or procerus muscle
activities in adults aged between 19 and 65 years. “BOTAONE
Inj.(Clostridium botulinum Toxin Type A)(For export only)” from
GENETOX was approved together with the approved purpose thereof, for
temporarily improving ocular wrinkles (wrinkle around the eye) in
moderate to severe cases associated with orbicularis oculi muscle activity
in adults aged 19 to 65 years of age,
In the case of blood products, 2 items were approved in 2017 and 1 item
was approved in 2018, but there were no newly approved items from 2019
to 2020. And 4 items were approved in 2021 and 5 items were approved in
2022 (refer to Table 40).
The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety operated the “Our Own Vaccine
Project” to provide intensive and systematic support so that domestic
COVID-19 vaccines could be developed quickly amid the COVID-19
situation. As a result, the COVID-19 vaccine developed and manufactured
by a Korean company was approved for the first time in the world.
In addition, Vaccine Center for Assisting Safety &Technology was
established to make efforts to preemptively respond to future infectious
diseases by providing technical support for commercialization of drug
development companies, such as basic consultation on vaccine
development, quality and clinical trials, etc.

3.2. Approval Status of Recombinant Protein Products
A total of 31 recombinant protein products were newly approved in
2022 (8 manufactured items and 23 imported items) including 6 new drugs
(including new orphan drugs) and 6 orphan drugs (excluding 3 new orphan
drugs), and 22 drugs requiring data submission (refer to Table 43).
In 2022, 5 ingredients and 6 items were designated as new drugs
(including new orphan drugs) while new drugs approved in 2021 were 4
ingredients and 5 items, which showed the increase in the number of new
drug approvals in 2022. 5 ingredients and 6 items were approved as orphan
drugs (excluding new orphan drugs) in 2022, which showed the increase
compared to 4 ingredients and 4 items approved in 2021.
“Ozempic Pre-filled Pen (semaglutide)” (Novo Nordisk Pharma Korea,
Ltd., 2022.04.28.), as a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist,
- 143 -was approved as a new drug that has been improved to be administered
once a week by increasing a half-life compared to the previously approved
Victoza Pen Inj. (liraglutide). It is administered as an adjunct to diet and
exercise therapy in adults with insufficient control of type 2 diabetes.
“Reblozyl Injection 25 mg(Luspatercept),” and “Reblozyl Injection 75
mg(Luspatercept)” (BMS Pharmaceutical Korea Ltd., 2022.5.9) were
approved as new orphan drugs used for the treatment of anemic adult
patients (beta thalassemia, myelodysplastic anemia). These drugs act on
endogenous inhibitors of late erythropoiesis to increase the release of
mature erythrocytes into the circulatory system.
“Enhertu Inj. 100 mg (Trastuzumab Deruxtecan)” (Daiichi Sankyo
Korea Co., Ltd., 2022.9.19) was approved as a new drug for the treatment
of HER2-positive breast cancer and HER2-positive gastric cancer. This
drug is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) in which a humanized
monoclonal antibody targeting HER2 and a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor are
linked in a conjugate, the antibody (Trastuzumab) specifically targets
HER2-expressing tumors, and a drug (Deruxtecan) inhibits cell proliferation
and induces tumor cell death.
“Poteligeo injection 20 mg (Mogamulizumab)” (Kyowa Kirin Korea Co.,
Ltd, 2022.9.22) was approved as a new orphan drug for the treatment of
adult patients with mycosis fungoides or Sézary syndrome who previously
received one or more systemic therapies. Mogamulizumab, the active
ingredient, induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity
that kills cancer cells by selectively binding to CCR4 expressed on the
surface of cancer cells.
- 144 -“Jemperli Inj. (dostarlimab)” (GSK Korea, 2022.12.14) was approved as
a new drug for the treatment of adult patients who have recurrent or
progressive mismatch repair deficient (dMMR)/high frequency microsatellite
instability-high (MSI-H) endometrial cancer. As a monoclonal antibody
targeting PD-1, immune checkpoint receptor of T cells, the drug blocks
cancer cells from using the PD-1 pathway to suppress cell activation,
thereby maintaining T-cell immune function.
“Rybrevant Injection (amivantamab)” (Janssen Korea Ltd., 2022.2.15) is
an orphan drug for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with an epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutation that has progressed during or
after platinum-based chemotherapy treatment. Amivantamab is an
EGFR-MET bispecific antibody that targets the EGFR and mesenchymal
epithelial transition (MET) pathways concurrently.
“Libtayo Injection (cemiplimab)” (Sanofi-aventis Korea, 2022.10.25.) is
an immuno-anticancer agent that binds specifically to the programmed cell
death 1 (PD-1) protein and blocks its interaction with the programmed
death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) and death protein ligand 2 (PD-L2). It was
approved as an orphan drug for use in locally advanced or metastatic
squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that is non-subject to curative
surgery or curative radiation therapy.
“Ultomiris Inj. 100 mg/mL (ravulizumab)” (Handok Inc., 2022.12.28) is a
product with increased concentration (10 mg/mL → 100 mg/mL) compared
to the previously approved item, “Ultomiris Inj. (ravulizumab)” (approved
on 2020.05.21.), and was approved as an orphan drug used for the same
- 145 -efficacy and effectiveness (paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, atypical
hemolytic uremic syndrome).
For biosimilars, 3 ingredients and 7 items were approved. Since the
approval of the monoclonal antibody biosimilar drug in 2012 for the first
time in the world, a total of 25 types and 42 items were approved until
2022. Out of them, there are a total of 17 types and 30 items of biosimilar
products developed in Korea (refer to Table 44).
“Alymsys Injection (bevacizumab)” (Alvogen Korea, 2022.1.19.) is a
biosimilar drug developed with Roche Korea’s Avastin Inj. (Bevacizumab)
as a reference product.
“AMELIVU” (Samsung Bioepis, 2022.5.13.) and “Chong Kun Dang
Ranibizumab inj.” (Chong Kun Dang Pharm., 2022.10.20.) are biosimilar
drugs developed in Korea with Novartis Korea’s Lucentis Inj. 10 mg/mL
(ranibizumab, recombinant) as a reference product.
“Vegzelma” (Celltrion, 2022.9.28.) is a biosimilar drug developed in
Korea with Roche Korea’s Avastin Inj. (bevacizumab) as a reference
product.
“Yuflyma Pre-filled Syringe Inj. 80 mg/0.8 mL (adalimumab, recombinant),”
“Yuflyma Pen Inj. 80 mg/0.8 mL (adalimumab, recombinant),” “Celltrion
Yuflyma Pen Inj. 40 mg/0.4 mL (adalimumab, recombinant)” (Celltrion,
2022.6.15./2022.11.10) are biosimilar drugs developed in Korea with AbbVie
Korea’s Humira 80 mg/0.8 mL (Adalimumab) and Humira 40 mg/0.4 mL
(Adalimumab) as reference products.
