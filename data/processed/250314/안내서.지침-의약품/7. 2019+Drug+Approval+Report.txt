- 3 -Among the total items (6,187 items), approved items and notified items accounted
for 59.7% (3,691 items) and 40.3% (2,496 items), respectively while 629 items (10.2%)
and 5,558 items (89.8%) were approved and/or notified by the headquarters and
regional offices, respectively. This shows the number of approved and notified items
increased sharply in 2019 compared with 2018.
Domestic items for manufacturing/marketing accounted for 97.5% (6,035 items)
whereas imported items, 2.5% (152 items) only. The drug products, drug substances,
and herbal substances accounted for 77.7% (4,809 items), 1.2% (71 items), and 21.1%
(1,307 items) respectively, which shows the number of drug products and herbal
substances increased sharply while that of imported items and drug substances was
similar to those in the previous year.
Drug products (98.5%) were significantly larger than drug substances (1.5%) when
excluding herbal substances, and the prescription drugs amounted to 86.1% (4,139
items) and the over-the-counter (OTC) drugs to 13.9% (670 items) respectively.
Like 2018, domestic items for manufacturing/marketing took the most among the
items approved and notified in 2019. However, there were no significant increase in
the number of approved and notified domestic items for manufacturing/marketing
(excluding herbal substances in 2018 (1,999 items) compared to 2017 (1,940 items),
but increased about 2.4 times in 2019 (4,728 items) compared to the previous year.
This is considered to be the effect of the surge in the number of approved (notified)
generic drug submitted with the consigned (joint) bioequivalence test data.
In case of the notification items (excluding herbal substances), due to introduction
of the pre-GMP of OTC drugs from July 1, 2009, the number of notification items
(753 items) in 2011 decreased significantly to almost the half as compared to that of
2010 (1,530 items) and later there was no significant change. However it increased
by 1.6 times (453 items) in 2019 compared to the previous year due to the surge in
the number of generic drugs.
- 4 -The number of approval and notification items for herbal substances increased to
1,307 items in 2019 by 3.6 times (946 items) compared to 361 items in 2018 because
of an increase in the number of items coming from notification of items made by
new drug manufacturers.

1) Of the 35 items, both orphan drug and new drug were 2 items
2) Chemical drugs newly approved in 2019 were 28 items, and the items designated as new drugs
according to the change in approvals were 4 items (Refer to Table 15).
To see the current status of new drug item approvals after 2010, the average
number of new drug approvals over the past 10 years was 31 items, the approvals
of new drugs were slow since 2016 but new drugs were approved more than the
average in 2019 (Refer to Table 13 and Figure 3).
According to the ratio of imported products from new drugs approved in 2019, the
imported items and the manufactured items were 88.6% and 11.4% respectively,
which shows the introduction of imported drugs to the domestic market still
influences the total number of new drugs. As for the number of ingredients, the
- 16 -imported items and the manufactured items took charge of 90.5% and 9.5%
respectively, which shows most of new substances introduced to the domestic
market are the imported items. New drugs developed in the country have been
steadily approved by 1~2 items each year (5 items in 2015), but in 2019, there was
neither approval of new drugs developed in the country nor visible development
results.

Orphan drugs approved in 2019 were 11 items in total (including 2 orphan new
drugs), which were all imported drugs and 8 chemical drug items and 3
biopharmaceutical items were approved. For the number of ingredients, 9 ingredients
were approved including 6 ingredients of chemical drugs, 3 ingredients of

According to orphan drug approvals since 2010, the number of items approved was
similar until 2014, but 49 items were approved in 2015, which is 1.8 times larger
than the annual average of approved items for the recent 5 years (27 items). This
seems to be an outcome of conducting of prior GMP program evaluation, review of
specifications and test methods, and submission of risk management plan for orphan
drugs since July 2015 (Refer to Table 18, Figure 4). From 2017, the approval of
orphan drugs tends to decrease and 17 items and 11 items were approved in 2018

The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety(MFDS) has been operating the “Pharm
Navi Project” since 2014 in order to support the fast commercialization of
domestically developed drugs and to support entry into the global market. “Pharm
Navi Project” was introduced to provide safe and excellent medicines to patients
promptly and to actively support new drug development research. Especially, the
new drug pipeline, innovation and unsatisfactory medical field items may be provided
with close consulting service through “Medical Product Commercialization
Navigator” through which the direction of the overall approval and review process
on real time base during the product development.
In addition, since July 2018, the MFDS has been operating a “pharm. together,”
a government-private sector communication channel in order to derive improvement
measures by discussing current problems or issues arising from the drug approval
and review process and also making efforts to resolve difficulties related to such
process through active and all time communications with the industry.
Furthermore, in case of inquiry into the overall approval and review process
- 40 -during drug development, consultations with the responsible department through the
consultation channel (MFDS website (www.mfds.go.kr) > “Reservation for One-Stop
Consultation”) is available. In addition, process of receiving a notice of the review
result through an application for “Prior Review” is available for those who wish to
obtain a drug item approval (notification) intend to have criteria for preparing data
for approval/notification reviewed in advance.

metabolizer (EM). Once gluceramide remains continuously without breakdown in cells
of the human body, metabolic inflammation occurs, which leads to Gaucher disease.
The active ingredient in this drug, ‘Eliglustatartartrate’ is a substrate reduction
treatment (SRT) that partially reduces the substrate that the glucoserebrosidase
enzyme causing Gaucher's disease by inhibiting glucosylceramide synthase should
break up.

authorizes as incrementally modified or medicinally advanced for the safety,
efficacy, and usefulness (medication compliance, convenience, etc.) compared to
approved (notified) drugs requiring data submission under Article 2(8) of the
Regulations for Pharmaceutical Approval, Notification and Review.
The development types of incrementally modified drugs approved for the last 5
years are as follows: development of combination drugs with new composition of
active substances (drugs containing 2 or more active ingredients in one product) was
noticeable from 2016 to 2017; and 6 SR tablet items with improved
administration/dosage by reducing the number of intakes were accepted as
incrementally modified drugs in 2018. In 2019, 13 items with improved efficacy (11
items) and improved usability (2 items) were approved as incrementally modified
drugs (Refer to Table 28).
The detailed acceptance criteria for the incrementally modified drugs (13 items)
approved in 2019 are as follows: 11 items of combination products with new
composition that proved their improved efficacy (increased treatment effects) (8
items of 2-drug combination for hyperlipidemia and 3 items of 3-drug combination
for hypertension); 1 item of pre-treatment bowel cleansing agent for colon
screening, of which usefulness was accepted through improvement of
administration/dosage of the previously approved items (total dose reduction: 3L, 4L
→ 2L); and 1 item of pre-treatment bowel cleansing agent for colon screening, of
which usability (medication compliance and convenience) was improved through new
composition and formulation improvement of active substance (liquid → tablet).

In addition, the MFDS published the 「Incrementally Modified Drug Approval
Casebook」 (Guide for Civil Petitioners) focusing on the current information and
cases of incrementally modified drugs to ensure the domestic pharmaceutical
industries may refer to the Guide for drug research and development. This Guide
provides the approval status, items by type, detailed acceptance criteria by case,
unaccepted cases, etc. of incrementally modified drugs (112 items) approved for
about 10 years since introduction of the incrementally modified drug system (since
Aug. 2008) including the incrementally modified drugs approved in 2019.
Approval of incrementally modified drugs by acceptance criteria is as follows: the
drugs with the improved efficacy (62 items, 55.4%) of which increased treatment
effects are proved, and those with the improved usefulness (39 items, 34.8%)
resulting from improved formulation accounted for about 90% of all incrementally
modified drugs, followed by 7 items (6.3%) recognized for advanced pharmaceutical
technology, and 4 items (3.5%) with improved safety (Figure 7).
